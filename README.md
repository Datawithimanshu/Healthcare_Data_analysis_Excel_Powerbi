🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis – Excel & Power BI

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a healthcare dataset to identify patterns in patient admissions, revenue generation, medical conditions, and hospital performance.

The analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel and Power BI, covering the complete workflow from raw data cleaning to interactive dashboard creation.

🎯 Project Objective

To transform raw healthcare data into meaningful insights by applying data cleaning, summarization, and visualization techniques using Excel and Power BI.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning, Filtering, Pivot Tables, Dashboard Design)

Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX Measures, Interactive Dashboard)

GitHub (Project Documentation & Version Control)

📂 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Raw Data Collection

Imported the original healthcare dataset containing patient records, billing information, admission types, and medical conditions.

2️⃣ Data Filtering & Cleaning (Excel)

Removed inconsistencies and unnecessary fields

Structured column formats

Verified data types

Prepared clean dataset for analysis

3️⃣ Pivot Table Analysis (Excel)

Created Pivot Tables to summarize key metrics:

Total Patients

Total Revenue

Admission Type Distribution

Medical Condition Analysis

Monthly Trends

4️⃣ Excel Dashboard Development

Designed an interactive healthcare performance dashboard using:

Pivot Charts

KPI Cards

Slicers (Gender, Admission Type, Year)

Trend Analysis Visuals

5️⃣ Power BI Data Modeling

Imported cleaned Excel data into Power BI

Created calculated measures using DAX

Structured relationships (if applicable)

Example DAX Measures:

Total Patients = COUNT(healthcare_dataset[Patient ID])

Total Revenue = SUM(healthcare_dataset[Billing Amount])

Average Stay = AVERAGE(healthcare_dataset[Stay Duration])

6️⃣ Power BI Dashboard Creation

Built an advanced interactive dashboard including:

KPI Cards

Revenue Analysis

Admission Type Comparison

Medical Condition Breakdown

Monthly Admission Trends

Top Revenue Generating Hospitals

📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Total Patients

Total Revenue

Average Stay Duration

Abnormal Test Result Percentage

📈 Key Insights

Emergency admissions accounted for a significant portion of total patients.

Certain medical conditions contributed more to overall revenue.

Monthly admission trends show fluctuations in patient inflow.

Average stay duration varies by admission type.
